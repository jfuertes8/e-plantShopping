## A React based project to practice React components and Redux

This project is part of a "Deep dive in React" course by **IBM**. This project presents a list of available products stored in a JSON format, and rendered via **React** components. Afterwards, I implement **Redux** in order to maintain a global state to store the selected products in a shopping-cart component.
